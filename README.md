# Cloudinary's WordPress Plugin

Cloudinary is a cloud service that offers a solution to a web application's entire image and video management pipeline. 
With Cloudinary, all your images are automatically uploaded, normalized, optimized and backed-up in the cloud instead of being hosted on your servers.

With Cloudinary, you can stop messing around with image editors. Cloudinary can manipulate and transform your images online, on-the-fly, directly from your WordPress console. Enhance your images using every possible filter and effect you can think of. All manipulations are done in the cloud using super-powerful hardware, and all resulting images are cached, optimized (smushed and more) and delivered via a lightning fast content delivery network (CDN).
